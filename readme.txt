      yw.csv, ywo.csv, mw.csv, mwo.csv, ow.csv, and owo.csv are the five features (the displacement along the x and y axis-ax & ay, the linear displacement-D, the angular displacement-a and the angle of rotation-b) we calculated for each participant, 'w' means with audio, 'wo' means without audio. These are inputs for machine learning algorithm.
